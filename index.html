    <p class="boxp">Call of Duty Zombies was a bonus mode created by Treyarch and was added all the way
        back in Call of Duty: World at War. The game mode has seen massive popularity in the series
        and has returned in every Treyarch Call of Duty since World at War. The series has even 
        seen alternate takes on the game mode in games like zombies in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare 
        and extinction in Call of Duty: Ghosts. The gamemode started with very simple mechanics like 
        buying weapons and opening doors with points and simply surviving as long as possible. They 
        later introduced perks, Pack a Punch, and new modes of transportation. In Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 
        they introduced main easter eggs which involved a series of steps that gave you a large reward and 
        usually gave you an achievement. The story over the years has developed a lot and has recently 
        come to a close with Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.
