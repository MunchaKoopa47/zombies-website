    <p class="formatp">Primis Nikolai Belinski does not suffer from substance abuse 
        <br>unlike his Ultimis counterpart. Primis Nikolai is much more rational
        <br>and likes his companions more in Dimension 63. He does not trust 
        <br>Richtofen but eventually becomes more reasonable. Nikolai becomes
        <br>leader of the group after Blood of the Dead.
        <br>
        <br>""Whatever has become of my former allies, I must follow guidance 
        <br>of Kronorium. There is much to do, and much to be undone."
        <br>
        <br>-Nikolai Belinski
