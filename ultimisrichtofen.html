    <p class="formatp">Edward Richtofen is essentially the leader of the ultimis group.
        <br>He had created the zombies and some of the weaponry seen in the maps.
        <br>Richtofen is a very delusional german scientist. He has mentioned 
        <br>hearing voices in his head and he yells a lot. He also has a very
        <br>eccentric personality.
