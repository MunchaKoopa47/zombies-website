    <p class="boxp">The story begins with the Keepers. After the construction of the Summoning Key,
        War breaks out between the Keepers and the now corrupt Apothicons. Apothicons are sealed in 
        the Dark Aether and send a corruption agent, Element 115, to Earth to start war amongst
        humans which will allow the Apothicons to escape the Dark Aether. Multiple organizations
        like Group 935 from Germany and Division 9 from Japan find this element and use it to make
        armies and weapons. Dr. Edward Richtofen and Dr. Ludwig Maxis are working together at a Group 935 facility 
        known as Der Riese when Richtofen betrays Maxis, trapping him, his daughter, and her dog in a teleporter. 
        Maxis is sent to the Crazy Place and fuses with electricity. Samantha is sent to the moon and becomes 
        the leader of the zombies and her pregnant dog Fluffy becomes an army of zombie dogs.
        Samantha seeks revenge on Richtofen so Richtofen and his test subjects with memory loss, being Tank Dempsey,
        Takeo Masaki, and Nikolai Belinksi, travel to various locations to gather artifacts. The group is betrayed by 
        Richtofen when they reach the moon and so they destroy the Earth to hinder Richtofen's ability to control the
        zombies. Marlton, Misty, Stuhlinger, and Russman are all survivors on Earth who are contacted by Maxis and Richtofen
        to help with each of their plans. They help Maxis but he is corrupted and begins to take over the world.
        Samantha travels to Dimension 63 where Richtofen and Maxis were actually friends in college.
        They are working with Element 115 at a German excavation site when zombies take over. Samantha contacts
        the four new characters, being Dempsey, Takeo, Nikolai, and Richtofen from Dimension 63, to save her
        and her father. They begin working with maxis capturing Samantha's soul, Maxis, and the four souls
        of themselves to store in "The House" where they can be kept from corruption. Dr. Monty assists them on
        this quest but ultimately betrays them and sets them in the cycle of Primis. The cycle is broken
        when Richtofen reaches Alcatraz in Purgatory, but he is late. The four escape because of Richtofen's sacrifice
        and they travel to the Nuketown Facility in Nevada. They gather the Elemental Shard and enlist the
        help of the four Earth survivors to kill Dr. Monty and fix the universe.
