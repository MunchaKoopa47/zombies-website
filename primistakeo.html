    <p class="formatp">Primis Takeo Masaki is a much more humble version of his 
        <br>ultimis counterpart. Primis Takeo still speaks of honor and
        <br>the emperor and has distrust of the others but he soon changes.
        <br>Takeo finds out from his future self that the emperor has 
        <br>betrayed him, which throws off his whole character.
        <br>
        <br>"Time... can be a cruel mistress. In its relentless march 
        <br>forward, it robs each of us of many things."
